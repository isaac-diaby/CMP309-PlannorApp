# CMP309-PlannorApp for mobile development module

Watch (Plannor App Presentation video)[https://youtu.be/zKd2JNNiFXY] for context and overview of the project. 

The app allows the user to track their contracted hours and hourly rate. The app will then calculate the users pay for the week. I use  Android Studio, Kotlin, Jetpack Compose and Firebase to build the app.

Ive removed the google-services.json and the build apk files from the project as it contains my firebase details. so you will need to add your own google-services.json file to the project to run it.
